Mission Statement
---
 
In Brief
---
AtNum's mission is to provide Cloud services utilising the latest technology and designs. As we move forward into a resource-constrained world, it is of critical importance that the resources available to humanity are shared equitably to bring the greatest benefit to all.
 
Core Mission
---
By creating an affordable, accessible and easy to use platform for educators and facilitators we hope to realise [` homo faber `](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_faber "Home Faber on Wiki") in the context that the natural world is more than a resource for human exploitation, rather our beautiful natural home to be cared for. 
 
Ecology
---
AtNum believes it is all our shared duty to care for and preserve the natural world. Our contribution will be through optimising resource utilisation in the cloud to limit power usage. The technical, calculation, and instrumental thinking of our time needs to be supplemented, and indeed contained, by an awareness of values deeper than utility for survival of something greater than we are.
