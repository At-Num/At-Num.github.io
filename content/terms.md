Jurisdictional Restrictions
---
 
SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT PERMIT CERTAIN LIABILITY LIMITATIONS OR WAIVERS. IF ANY COURT DETERMINES THE LAW OF SUCH A JURISDICTION APPLIES, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
Dispute Resolution; Limit on Time to Bring Claim; Arbitration of Claims; Class Action Waiver
 
ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION RELATING TO, ARISING UNDER OR OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY PURCHASES OR SUBSCRIPTIONS MADE THROUGH THE WEBSITE, OUR PRIVACY POLICY, OR THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.
 
Both you and we agree to resolve all disputes between you and us regarding the Website, Products, our Privacy Policy, THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, or otherwise through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OR IN YOUR LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIM MEETS its JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. IF YOU CHOOSE ARBITRATION, THAT MEANS YOU AND WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO HAVE OUR DISPUTE HEARD IN COURT, AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
 
 
Arbitration Fees and Costs. If you commence an arbitration in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, you will be required to pay a filing fee in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. You will not be responsible for paying any fees for the arbitration other than the filing fee; we will pay all other fees or expenses charged.
 
Attorneys’ Fees. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees; we will not pay any of your attorneys’ fees unless ordered to do so by the arbitrator. For the avoidance of doubt, in cases where a statute gives you the right to recover attorneys’ fees if you prevail, the arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees pursuant to that statute.
 
Delegation; Interpretation. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to the extent permitted by law to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms and Conditions, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable. This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and will survive termination of these Terms and Conditions.
 
Class Action Waiver. Both you and we waive the right to bring any dispute regarding your use of the Website, Products, including any purchases or Subscriptions made through the Website, our Privacy Policy, or these Terms and Conditions as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action brought by anyone else concerning any such dispute.

If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be invalid, you and we agree that the court or arbitrator should nevertheless endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect.
