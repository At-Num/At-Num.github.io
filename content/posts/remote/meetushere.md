Meetushere a website for independent educators
---
 
Meetushere is a website for you as an independant educator. Using Meetushere you can monetise your content by charging your students a flat fee.
 
Why [Meetushere](https://meetushere.com)
----
 
The whole purpose of Meetushere is to help people create and be innovative. Meetushere has costs, server, bandwidth and development to name but a few.
You as an educator/ content creator also have costs.  
 
The current "tube" or "app store" model leverages advertising to cover these costs, however AtNum thinks that having ***ads pushed into your face*** is the exact opposite of ***create and be innovative***.
