Payment models and monetizing your content
---
Meetushere does not use your content to generate revenue from advertising and we never will ever period!! 
 
When you teach on the site, stream content to your students, your students will only pay a flat fee. We will take a commission usually 20% for running costs and the remainder will be paid to you. 
 
Marketing and promotions
---
We have the ability to vary the commision by using what we call a Promo Code. 
Currently while we are starting up we are offering a flat 10% commision using the Promo Code 'MUH10OFF'
 
- when scheduling a meeting or uploading content for streaming
- enter  MUH10OFF in the Promo Code textbox
- you will only be charged a 10% commission for that meeting or content
 
Payment models for promotions or specialist educators
---
It can be the case that you will need to allow your students to access your content for free, for example you could be a practitioner, a Speech Therapist for example, woking from a grant to help low socio-economic students
 
- you can request a Promo Code to enable your students to access your content
 for free, you will need to cover the running costs from your funding source
- you may seek to partially cover the cost for your students, you can request
 a Promo Code for this case too

Sadly at this time we can not change the costs for individual students. Promo Codes apply to a meeting or streaming specific content as a whole.
