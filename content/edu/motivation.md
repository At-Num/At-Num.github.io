Our motivation at AtNum for the development of Remote Learning Solutions is to add both Simplicity and Security simultaneously with ease of access. 
Every learning institution will have unique requirements but all will struggle with the above.

Here at AtNum we are actively researching emerging remote learning solutions and technologies. Having worked extensively in secondary and tertiary education as well as software engineering we feel we have the background to speak authentically on this topic.

During our research we came across this tool [Lecture Studio](https://www.lecturestudio.org/) an emerging technology from the German University system particularly the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.etit.tu-darmstadt.de/fachbereich/index.en.jsp).

Lecture Studio is an emerging technology that we are actively researching, indeed we have refactored its core component LecturePresenter to remove many of its low level system dependencies and greatly simplified its functionality to create a much simpler and possibly more secure tool ***AtNum Content Creator***.  

AtNum Content Creator is designed for the less technically minded teacher, it can run on older, resource constrained computers that you would typically find in a [hot desk environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_desking) in a secondary school department staff room or in a computer lab. As part of our commitment to remote learning we have made this tool freely available. Please see our post AtNum Content Creator here for more information about this tool. 

We work with another technology [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/), BigBlueButton differs from Lecture studio in the respect that it is primarily focused on video conferencing with a number of additional components useful for education. One issue with BigBlueButton is it is resource heavy and requires a large server to run a typical class of 28 + students. We have researched a number of strategies to mitigate this leveraging [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/).  

We have developed our website [meetushere](https://meetushere.com) to both schedule video conferences to run on BigBlueButton and also the independent functionality to stream pre prepared videos or screencasts directly from Oracle Cloud. AtNum Content Creator is ideal for creating screencasts to stream from  [meetushere](https://meetushere.com).

Bertrand Russell in his work on the philosophy of education ***On Education*** developed a schema for intelligence, as the ability to acquire knowledge, Remote Learning can increase the possibility for the development of intelligence primarily by  creating opportunities through which the students' power of thinking can be developed. 

In my personal teaching methodology I call this enrichment.  

It is important to note that Russell saw intelligence as just one component of character or personality,  Remote Learning should never replace the role of a class teacher but rather extend the teachers resources to impart to the students an education for a good life.
