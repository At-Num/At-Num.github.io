Any experienced educator will tell you the main challenge we face is student motivation. That same educator will tell you the number one answer to this challenge is student choice. 
 
We here at AtNum have been developing the software for the [MeetUsHere](https://meetushere.com/) project. This has required thousands of lines of code in more than 5 programming languages, endless testing and deployments. 
 
How do we maintain personal motivation?, by giving ourselves a chance to work on something different that we enjoy in computer science. 
 
We make a choice to study or participate in something new that we find interesting. 
 
Think of this as an enrichment process. We will gain some new skills that we can then possibly apply to our main project(s). 
 
More than this, the choice to learn something new is essentially a creative process, the consequence of which is a metaphorical "charging of batteries" that gives us renewed motivation to return to our primary tasks with renewed energy and purpose. 
 
As educators the most rewarding experience has been to participate in learning communities(usually schools) in different cultures. We have taught in remote indigenos schools in Darwin and Alice springs, We have taught in inner city London schools. We have taught in schools in South America
 
To collaborate with teachers from diverse backgrounds in South America, the EU, Africa, the Caribbean, Asia and beyond that you will encounter in these schools is a privilege of a lifetime.
 
However these are our personal experiences, how can we share these types of experiences, that both enrich and provide for creativity.
 
This is AtNum's motivation as we seek to build a remote learning community to do just this, to provide choice and diversity in education for everyone.
