weight: 200
---
Nigel has 15+ years experience working in Tertiary and Higher education. Nigel completed the final year of his Education diploma under Adelaide University's Distinguished Professor of Sociology Jerry Smoliz who was the architect of Australiaâ€™s multicultural policy. 

On completion of his Mathematics degree he worked extensively as an engineering tutor with a focus on Computer Science and Electrical engineering. At this time he won a junior lecturing position in a matriculation department teaching mathematics and statistics. Despite working as a telecom and software engineer Nigel maintained his interest in tertiary education and gained a teaching diploma in 2002.  

While working at a senior high school he became aware of the following truism "it takes 5 years to fully understand the teaching role, it takes 10 years to become one" He has 10 years experience teaching in senior high schools in Australia and the UK.   

Nigel met Lex while working on developing the software for Lex's [MeetUsHere](https://meetushere.com/) project. He is continuing his collaboration with Lex's company AtNum to deliver remote education via the Big Blue Button framework as an online teaching tool.  

In 2021 Nigel collaborated with the acclaimed author and educator [Alex Kelly](https://www.routledge.com/Talkabout/book-series/SMT). Nigel developed the software for her latest "Tass" project aimed at developing communication skills for students with diagnosed learning behaviors.
 
During his extensive teaching experience Nigel has identified two core areas where student needs are not currently being met.
- education for students with a social disadvantage
- advanced or gifted students gaining access to the fundamental
  concepts of pure mathematics 
 
Both of these needs can be addressed with technology, particularly video conferencing which allows schools access to the specialist educators such as Alex Kelly with her cohort of doctoral students or educators like Nigel with strong backgrounds in Pure Mathematics.
 
Nigel has a longstanding commitment to improving the life chances of students by integrating education with technology. Through his collaboration with AtNum Nigel hopes to facilitate a community of vibrant educators that can provide opportunities to address unmet student needs.
