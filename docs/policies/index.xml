      <description>Mission Statement In Brief AtNum&amp;rsquo;s mission is to provide Cloud services utilising the latest technology and designs. As we move forward into a resource-constrained world, it is of critical importance that the resources available to humanity are shared equitably to bring the greatest benefit to all.
Core Mission By creating an affordable, accessible and easy to use platform for educators and facilitators we hope to realise homo faber in the context that the natural world is more than a resource for human exploitation, rather our beautiful natural home to be cared for.</description>
