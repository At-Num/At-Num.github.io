      <description>Our motivation at AtNum for the development of Remote Learning Solutions is to add both Simplicity and Security simultaneously with ease of access. Every learning institution will have unique requirements but all will struggle with the above.
Here at AtNum we are actively researching emerging remote learning solutions and technologies. Having worked extensively in secondary and tertiary education as well as software engineering we feel we have the background to speak authentically on this topic.</description>
