We here at AtNum have been developing the software for the MeetUsHere project. This has required thousands of lines of code in more than 5 programming languages, endless testing and deployments.
How do we maintain personal motivation?, by giving ourselves a chance to work on something different that we enjoy in computer science.</description>
